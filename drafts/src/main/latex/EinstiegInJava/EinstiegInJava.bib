  abstract = {{O}ne of the challenges of ambient systems lies in providing all the
	available services of the environment to the ambient devices, even
	if they do not physically host those services. {A}lthough this challenge
	has come to find a solution through cloud computing, there are still
	few devices and operating systems that enable applications execution
	by only uploading the required components into the runtime environment.
	{T}he {ROCS} ({R}emote {OSG}i {C}aching {S}ervice) framework is a
	novel proposal which relies on a heavy-weighted standard {J}ava/{OSG}i
	stack. {I}t is distributed between class servers and ambient devices
	to provide full functionalities to resource-constrained environments.
	{T}he {ROCS} framework provides improvements in two areas. {F}irst,
	it defines a minimal bootstrap environment that runs a standard {J}ava/{OSG}i
	stack. {S}econdly, it provides an architecture for loading any necessary
	missing class from remote servers into memory at runtime. {O}ur first
	results show similar performances when classes are either remotely
	downloaded into the main memory from a local network or from a flash
	drive. {T}hese results suggest a way to design minimalistic middleware
	that dynamically obtain their applications from the network as a
	first step towards cloud-aware operating systems.},
